            <p>Normally, JavaScript works on the browser, also called client, side. Your browser runs on any website, including this one, to process and complete data.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is so popular because it works a lot like English, and can be as simple or complex as you want it to be. JavaScript also comes with <a href="../../nodejs/introduction.html">NodeJS</a>,
            packaged with npm and npx, which runs on the server-side as opposed to the client-side. It can also return error codes, make Discord bots, GitHub apps, and much, much more.</p>
